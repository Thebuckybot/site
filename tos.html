      </p>
      <p>

      </p>
      <p>
        By accessing or using the Service You agree to be bound by these Terms and Conditions. If You disagree with any part of these Terms and Conditions then You may not access the Service.
      </p>
      <p>
        Your access to and use of the Service is also conditioned on Your acceptance of and compliance with our Privacy Policy.
      </p>

      <h3>Links to Other Websites</h3>
      <p>
        Our Service may contain links to third-party websites or services that are not owned or controlled by Bucky Bot.
      </p>
      <p>
        Bucky Bot has no control over, and assumes no responsibility for, the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party websites or services. You further acknowledge and agree that the Company shall not be responsible or liable, directly or indirectly, for any damage or loss caused or alleged to be caused by or in connection with the use of or reliance on any such content, goods or services available on or through any such websites or services.
      </p>
      <p>
        We strongly advise you to read the terms and conditions and privacy policies of any third-party websites or services that you visit.
      </p>

      <h3>Termination</h3>
      <p>
        We may terminate or suspend Your access immediately, without prior notice or liability, for any reason whatsoever, including without limitation if You breach these Terms and Conditions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Upon termination, Your right to use the Service will cease immediately.
      </p>

      <h3>Disclaimer</h3>
      <p>
        The Service is provided to You "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" and with all faults and defects without warranty of any kind. To the maximum extent permitted under applicable law, the Company, on its own behalf and on behalf of its affiliates and its and their respective licensors and service providers, expressly disclaims all warranties, whether express, implied, statutory or otherwise, with respect to the Service, including all implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title and non-infringement, and warranties that may arise out of course of dealing, course of performance, usage or trade practice.
      </p>
      <p>
        Without limitation to the foregoing, the Company provides no warranty or undertaking, and makes no representation of any kind that the Service will meet Your requirements, achieve any intended results, be compatible or work with any other software, applications, systems or services, operate without interruption, meet any performance or reliability standards or be error free or that any errors or defects can or will be corrected.
      </p>
      <p>
        Without limiting the foregoing, neither the Company nor any of the Company's providers makes any representation or warranty of any kind, express or implied: (i) as to the operation or availability of the Service, or the information, content, and materials or products included thereon; (ii) that the Service will be uninterrupted or error-free; (iii) as to the accuracy, reliability, or currency of any information or content provided through the Service; or (iv) that the Service, its servers, the content, or e-mails sent from or on behalf of the Company are free of viruses, or other harmful components.
      </p>

      <h3>Exclusions</h3>
      <p>
        Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain types of warranties or limitations on applicable statutory rights of a consumer, so some or all of the above exclusions and limitations may not apply to You. But in such a case the exclusions and limitations set forth in this section shall be applied to the greatest extent enforceable under applicable law.
      </p>

      <h3>Governing Law</h3>
      <p>
        The laws of the country in which the Company operates, excluding its conflicts of law rules, shall govern these Terms and Your use of the Service. Your use of the Service may also be subject to other local, state, national, or international laws.
      </p>

      <h3>Indemnification</h3>
      <p>
        You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Bucky Bot and its subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, employees, contractors and directors from and against any and all claims, damages, obligations, losses, liabilities, costs or debts, and expenses (including but not limited to lawyer's fees), resulting from or arising out of your use and access of the Service, or a breach of these Terms.
      </p>

      <h3>Disputes Resolution</h3>
      <p>
        If You have any concern or dispute about the Service, You agree to first try to resolve the dispute informally by contacting the Company.
      </p>

      <h3>Severability</h3>
      <p>
        If any provision of these Terms is held to be unenforceable or invalid, such provision will be changed and interpreted to accomplish the objectives of such provision to the greatest extent possible under applicable law and the remaining provisions will continue in full force and effect.
      </p>

      <h3>Changes to These Terms and Conditions</h3>
      <p>
        We reserve the right, at Our sole discretion, to modify or replace these Terms at any time. If a revision is made, We will make reasonable efforts to provide at least 30 days' notice prior to any new terms taking effect. What constitutes a material change will be determined at Our sole discretion.
      </p>
      <p>
        By continuing to access or use Our Service after those revisions become effective, You agree to be bound by the revised terms. If You do not agree to the new terms, in whole or in part, you are no longer allowed to use the Service.
